[ID:nL5N11T014]\n    Coal is the main fuel for electricity in China, but power\noutput is now growing at only 4 percent per year, far below\nannual growth rates of around 10 percent since 2000, Morgan\nStanley noted.\n    China's coal imports have collapsed some 30 percent since\nthe beginning of the year, even as major producers China Shenhua\nEnergy <601088.SS> <1088.HK> and China Coal Energy <601898.SS>\n<601898.HK> cut domestic output.\n    Morgan Stanley expects a short-term recovery in coal prices\nover the next year, followed by a flat price outlook for an\nextended period.\n    The fall in coal prices, along with routs for other mined\nraw materials such as iron ore, has contributed to a clobbering\nof the shares of BHP Billiton <BHP.AX>, Rio Tinto <RIO.AX> and\nother mining giants, which have taken a bigger beating than\nthose of most energy firms. [ID:nL5N11Z1DK]\n    Weakening currencies of resource-rich producers such as\nAustralia, South Africa and Columbia has also added to the glut\nof coal and other mined commodities. \n    \"In the massive, highly competitive global thermal coal\ntrade, any favourable exchange rate move simply encourages\nexposed miners to lift or sustain production rates in order to\npreserve market share,\" Morgan Stanley's Price said.\n    A drop in oil prices have also helped miners lower\nproduction costs by 5 to 10 percent this year, he said.\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nGRAPHIC-API2 coal futures:    http://link.reuters.com/rap75w\nGRAPHIC-Coal producer share prices:     http://link.reuters.com/tap75w\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Editing by Tom Hogue)\n ((jacob.pedersen@thomsonreuters.com; +65 6417 4529; Reuters\nMessaging: jacob.pedersen.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))\n\nKeywords: CHINA COAL/PRICES
